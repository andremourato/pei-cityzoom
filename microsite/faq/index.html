<p>                                            Alice is a 41 year old Biology Teacher. Although young, she has made a lot of progress towards environmental education in the school where she teaches. She likes to attend conferences about environment, but the ones she likes the most are the ones about city climates, the impact of each different part of the urban planning on them and how to study them. In one of these conferences she heard that green areas aren't just less polluted, but their temperatures and radiation levels differ a bit from the city blocks. After hearing this she decided a great way to choose when she'll go for a stroll in a park would be to check out her city park temperature, humidity and radiation.

                                        <p>Filipe is a respected mechanical engineer known for his work in making wind turbines more efficient. Also for this reason the mayor of Aveiro invited him to be his secretary for environment and he did not refuse. Living in a smart city as Aveiro he thought he would have an easier control over the city current ambiental status and traffic. To his disappointment he had a lot of data coming from many sensors around the city, but he could only visualize it in a rudimentar and inefficient way. He could not visualize the environmental data with ease and the traffic data were only tables that offer little to no help. If he wanted to find irregularities he would have to search all sensors one by one and identify if there was an irregularity and in which sensor. Besides being tedious, all this task would be very much time consuming, time he needed for various other things. Because of this need of time he tried to find a system that could help him firstly visualize the data he got from the sensors and secondly to help him find irregularities within the city environment or traffic. </p>

                                        <p>Joana is a 23 year old student of environmental engineering whose masters thesis is about the impact of green areas in the city environment and how it affects the well being of the citizens. She always liked city green areas since her childhood because these were the places where she saw a little bit of nature in her city. This was the reason why she chose this theme for her masters thesis. She finds it extremely difficult to collect, modulate and analyze all environmental data about the city while also collecting data from the city inhabitants. This difficulty arises mainly because when she wants to analyze the behaviour of the citizens she needs someone to collect the environmental data in parallel and needs also to modulate all of it while still needing to analyze it so the tests made can be more accurate. To simplify this task she would need a system that could give the environmental data about the city in a fast and accurate way and compare the results of any given moment with another in a visible and meaningful way other than just plain tables with data. For her, this system would give her access to the data that she preciously needs without effort and would allow her to gather the citizens data in a more efficient way and speed up the analyzing process.                                            </p>

Now after the end of a day of citizen data gathering she just goes home and opens up CityZoom dashboard to view how the state of the city throughout the day and saves the data. Sheâ€™s happy because besides raw data gathering, CityZoom also displays how accurate the data is in the sensors and a basic modulation of the data.</p>

With this she just compared the behaviour of some citizens and then just opened the comparative view of moments in the CityZoom app and chose a few moments of those days.</p>

After finding the her favourite city park in the temperature heatmap of the city she checks the temperature and finds out that it is actually much warmer than her own suburb and decides sheâ€™ll be spending the day with her family at the park.</p>
