                                        <hr class="half-rule" />
                                        <p>&emsp;On this section, we explain some of the main features of the system, as well as an explanation on its usage.
                                        <br><br>
                                        &emsp;CityZoom is a platform designed to provide the city manager a web application to gather environmental information from a city and act accordingly.
                                         A mobile application was also developed for citizens that allows them to give more environmental data of the place where they are.
                                        <br><br>
                                        &emsp;The application has 2 main interfaces with different goals:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The homepage dashboard, designed to give previews of the environmental data where the user is;</li>
                                            <li>The map view, designed to help the city manager check the city overall status with heatmaps over the different streams of data;</li>
                                        </ul><br>
                                        &emsp;There are many types of sensor verticals and streams allowed on the system. 
                                        An administrator can add sensors to the platform if the given sensor has the specified vertical(s). 
                                        <br><br>
                                        &emsp;As a city manager, besides the access to all environmental data, you can also add alerts to specific locations, with a threshold value. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        &emsp;The mobile application, destinated to the citizens, allows them to give some data from their smartphones. 
                                        In the future it would give them an access-token in order to create devices and post data to the CityZoom web application.
                                        <br><br>
                                        &emsp;The homepage dashboard has the following main features:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Check the history of sensors' streams;</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        &emsp;The map view has the following main features:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Check all sensors' streams values in real-time;</li>
                                            <li>Check the location of all the sensors in a map;</li>
                                            <li>Add alerts (optionally with actuators) to sensors' streams;</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        &emsp;For the sensor technician, the platform has the following features:
                                         <ul>
                                            <li>API to add sensors dynamically (CRUD compliant);</li>
                                            <li>API to add streams dynamically;</li>
                                            <li>Dynamic location of sensors.</li>
                                         </ul>
                    
                                        </p>

                                        <h4 align="left">Web portal and admin portal</h4>
                                        <p>&emsp;For accessing the web portal and admin portal you just need to go to <a href="http://http://178.62.255.129/" target="_blank">this link</a>. When logged, you will be redirected to the dashboard web portal page. If you want to go to the admin portal, click on the top right button ("Change to admin view"). You will need an account, that can only be created by an administrator of the system.</p><br>
                                        <h4 align="left">Mobile application</h4>
                                        <p>&emsp;The mobile applications are designed to run on android operating system (version 4.0 or higher). You need to download the .apk file and install it on your smartphone. The apps are free to use, and no login is required.</p>
                                    </div>

                                        <h3>How it works</h3>
                                        <hr class="half-rule" />
                                        <p>&emsp;In this section, we present the web portal, the admin portal and the mobile application along with an explanation of usage.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h4 align="left">Web portal</h4>
                                        <p>
                    
                                            &emsp;The first view of the web portal is the authentication page. If the user is not authenticated, it doesn’t have the permission to see any information of the metrics gathered. If the username and password entered by the user match with a valid account, the webpage will redirect the user to the main dashboard page. Each account can have streams associated. A stream is a flow of data send by the sensors (for example: pressure of air sensor x, or waste containter percentage of waste sensor y). If an account doesn't have any streams, it will not be possible to see any information of the sensors.
                                            <br><br><div class="h-caption"><a href="#" class="pop" data-title="Authentication view" data-desc=""><img id="Authentication_View" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="./assets/images/web_portal/Login.png" alt="Authentication View"></a><br><h6>Authentication view</h6></div>
                                            <br>
                                            &emsp;The main page of the web portal contains a dashboard with information about the type of metrics gathered by the sensors (temperature/lighting/air/waste/noise/radiation/people). For each type of metric, there is a card with information about the last values retrieved by the sensors.
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>For the temperature sensors, will be displayed the average temperature of all temperature sensors allowed to the user, as well as the maximum and minimum value.</li>
                                            <li>For the lighting sensors, will be displayed the number of sensors that have dimming higher than 75% and between 50% and 75%.</li>
                                            <li>For the air sensors, will be displayed the average carbon dioxide values, as well as the maximum and minimum values.</li>
                                            <li>For the waste containers sensors, it will be displayed the number of containers that have a waste usage higher than 75% and between 50% and 75%.</li>
                                            <li>For the noise sensors, it will be displayed the maximum noise value detected, as well as the average for the allowed streams</li>
                                            <li>For the radiation sensors, it will be displayed the number of sensors with UV Radiation index above 7 and between 4 and 7.</li>
                                            <li>For the people counter sensors, it will be displayed the number of places that have their lotation higher than 75% and between 50% and 75%.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            &emsp;For all the cards, it will also be shown the number of active and inactive streams and the date from last reading. All this information will be from the sensors that are currently working.
                                            <br><br>
                                            &emsp;Bellow the cards, there is a notification panel. The first tab contains a list of all the triggered alerts, alongside with its information. An alert can be added by the user on the sensor metrics page or alerts page. An alert is a maximum or minimum threshold for a number of subscriptions, that can be turned on or off according to a schedule. It is also possible to act when an alarm is triggered by adding a actuator (e.g. when it is 7 p.m., turn on public lighting), sending a message to all the actuators.
                                            <br><br>
                                            &emsp;The "Triggered alerts" tab shows the occurrences by date. These can have two states: <i>active</i> and <i>inactive</i>. If an triggered alert is <i>active</i>, it means that the sensor values are currently crossing a threshold. When it stops, the state will be <i>inactive</i>. If the user wants to dismiss the alert notification, he can do it and it will no longer be in the "Triggered alerts".
                                            <br><br>
                                            &emsp;The "User reports" tab shows the information about the reports sent by the citizens through the mobile app. Each user report can be on one of three states: <i>waiting</i>, <i>working on</i> and <i>solved</i>. When the state is changed to <i>solved</i>, the report will no longer be shown on this tab.
                                            <br><br>
                                            &emsp;The "Sensors with inactive streams" tab shows an exaustive list of all sensors that have one or more inactive streams. Besides that, it shows the sensors' status in the platform (on or off, defined by the user).
                                            <br><br>
                                            &emsp;Finally, there is also a panel with notes added by the user. If the user wants to add a note, he can click on "Add note" and fill the popup form with the adequate information.
                                            <br><br>
                                            &emsp;On the left sidebar, we can access different pages of the web portal.
                                            <br><br><div class="h-caption"><a href="#" class="pop" data-title="Main dashboard page" data-desc=""><img id="Main_Dashboard_Page" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal" src="./assets/images/web_portal/main_Dash.png" alt="Main Dashboard Page"></a><br><h6>Main dashboard page (Click to enlarge)</h6></div><br>
                                            &emsp;The map view contains a map with the location of all the sensors allowed to that user, with a filter to select the sensor types that are visible on the map. When the user clicks on top of a sensor, it will appear a popup box with information about that sensor and a toggle switch to turn on or off the streams of that sensor (the toggle will NOT be used to turn on or off the sensor, but to turn on or off the retrieval of data from streams of that sensor). 
                                            If several sensors are too close to use separate markers only one will appear and clicking on it will expand all the sensors' markers.

In case of the sensors have more that one subtype (e.g. waste sensors can have streams of usage container percentage, internal temperature and volume), each subtype will have a chart (separated by tabs). It is possible to zoom in on a date on the chart and filter by the subscriptions wanted.

If the stream is an actuator, it is possible to send data by clicking on the "Send" button on the "Send values" column. After that, a popup is open, where the user can insert a numeric value to send to the stream.

For that, we click on "Add" Button, on the "Subscriptions" card, and we enter the information of the subscription in the form. The subscription id is the id returned by the broker when adding the IoT City Web Portal as a subscriptor to the stream. The sensor subtype is the subtype of that subscription (e.g. For the waste container type there are the subtypes of waste percentage of containter, internal container temperature and waste volume). We can also specify if the subscription sends or receives values (if receives values is an actuator), by checking or unchecking the "sender" checkbox.

To add a sensor to the platform, the technician can send a 'POST' request to /ws/addsensor. The body of the request must contain the following fields:
                                            <ul>
